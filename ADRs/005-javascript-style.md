### Decision

Document JavaScript code style guidelines, and adopt Prettier and ESLint across all MDN codebases.

### Context

We have a number of repositories across the MDN organization that uses JavaScript. To ease 
contributions, shorten pull requests review time, and ease transition between projects,
it is suggested that we adopt a JavaScript code style guide across all projects inside the MDN org.

To ensure that the guidlines are followed, it is also suggested that we utilise Prettier for formatting,
and ESLint for linting across all projects via standard configurations.

### Consequences

We have a standard JavaScript code style across projects, and tools that enforce these standards. 

### Alternatives Considered

This is very norrowly scoped and suggests tools that are standard across the industry, so other options
have not been explored.
